## Problem Statement

This particular problem statement is to find the most gratifying reward system for Starbucks customers that positively affected their sales as well as which demographics make purchases with no reward incentive. There also may be some rewards that work in some areas and not in others, as well as the fact that some rewards may be unnecessary if the consumer would be making purchases without a reward.

The goal for the machine learning is to use classication to determine what is the most cost effective way to ensure consumer transactions (which may or may not include a reward offer) based on the input of a consumer with a specic set of features covering both the user's personal attributes as well as those of the rewards program they are interacting with.
